/*
js is syncronous , single threaded
it is an deafult behaviour of js 
execution context
- execute one line of code at a time 
- each operation waits for the last one to compile before executing

- block coe = black the flow of program , "read file sync"
- non bloacking code = does not blaock execution - "read file async"
